I'm Okamuya, a Brazilian writer. My goal is to be able to gain notoriety and prominence, in some way, in the book business - and also role-playing.- ðŸ‘‹
I'm interested in games, but mainly in writing. I like the knowledge and the challenge proposed for this.ðŸ‘€
I intend to collaborate with communities and learn from anyone who can teach me.- 
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
âš¡ Fun fact: A funny fact is that I'm crazy, it doesn't mess with me... I'm crazy.
